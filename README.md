## About

The Maritime Emissions Map (MEM) displays the latest reported greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large industrial facilities across the Atlantic provinces. This project's goal is to make the data, and the story they tell, easily accessible to industry and non-industry Atlantic Canadians alike.

The data shown are current as of October 31, 2023, and will be updated as the latest data is released from the Government of Canada's [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/facility-reporting/about.html). Emissions data are self-reported as mandated in Section 46 of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*.
